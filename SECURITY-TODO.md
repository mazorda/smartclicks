# Security Implementation Plan

## Current Security Setup (Development)

### Environment Variables
- [x] .env properly gitignored
- [x] .env.example provided with necessary variables
- [x] Basic environment variable validation in Supabase client

### Supabase Configuration
- [x] RLS enabled with permissive policies for development
- [x] Basic authentication flow implemented
- [x] Type-safe Supabase client setup

### Frontend Security
- [x] Environment variables properly loaded via import.meta.env
- [x] Basic error handling for missing environment variables
- [x] Session persistence configured

## TODO: Security Improvements

### 1. Environment Variables & Configuration
- [ ] Add runtime validation for all environment variables
- [ ] Implement environment variable type checking
- [ ] Add validation for API response schemas
- [ ] Set up proper development vs production environment configs

### 2. Supabase Security
- [ ] Implement strict RLS policies:
  - [ ] Proper user isolation
  - [ ] Resource-based access control
  - [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Set up row-level encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Implement proper service role usage
- [ ] Add database function security policies

### 3. Frontend Security
- [ ] Implement proper XSS protection:
  - [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - [ ] Input sanitization
  - [ ] Output encoding
- [ ] Add request/response interceptors for security headers
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Set up proper error boundaries with PII protection

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Set up proper session timeout
- [ ] Implement proper password policies
- [ ] Add account lockout after failed attempts

### 5. Data Protection
- [ ] Implement proper data encryption at rest
- [ ] Set up secure file upload handling
- [ ] Add proper PII handling
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Set up proper backup security

### 6. API Security
- [ ] Add proper API authentication
- [ ] Implement request validation
- [ ] Set up proper CORS policies
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

### 7. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up security event logging
- [ ] Implement proper error tracking
- [ ] Add security alert system
- [ ] Set up audit logging
- [ ] Implement proper log rotation

### 8. Testing
- [ ] Add security-focused integration tests
- [ ] Implement penetration testing
- [ ] Add authentication flow testing
- [ ] Set up continuous security scanning
- [ ] Implement proper test data handling

## Current Temporary Permissions

### RLS Policies (Development)
```sql
-- Current permissive policies for development
create policy "Allow anonymous audit creation"
on public.domain_audits for insert
to anon, authenticated
with check (true);

create policy "Allow anonymous audit views"
on public.domain_audits for select
to anon, authenticated
using (true);

create policy "Allow updates"
on public.domain_audits for update
to anon, authenticated
using (true)
with check (true);
```

### Areas Needing Immediate Review
1. Anonymous access to domain_audits table
2. Unrestricted update permissions
3. Lack of user isolation in queries
4. Missing delete policies
5. Overly permissive service role usage

## Security Contacts
- Primary Security Contact: [TO BE ADDED]
- Secondary Security Contact: [TO BE ADDED]
- Security Email: [TO BE ADDED]

## Incident Response
1. Identify and isolate the affected systems
2. Assess the scope of the breach
3. Contain the security incident
4. Notify affected parties
5. Document the incident
6. Implement fixes and preventive measures

Note: This is a living document that should be updated as security measures are implemented and new requirements are identified.
